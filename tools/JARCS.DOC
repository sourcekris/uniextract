--=[ INTRODUCTION ]=====-----------------------------------------------------

JARCS is a compression program that attempts to beat all the lame compression
programs. This is the documentation for it.

This is a public GAMMA version, please be careful in using this archiver. It
has been tested, but not fully. If you find any bugs, please report to
Junichi Uekawa. A Fidonet conference JARCS and JARCS.BETA are available.


--=[ FILES IN THE ARCHIVE ]=======-------------------------------------------


    JARCS.EXE       The main executable, that is optimized.
    JARCSD.EXE      The debug compile of the executable (beta/alpha only)
    JARCSX.EXE      The 32-bit version of the executable (32-bit dist only)
    UNJAR.EXE       The UNJAR utility that will stay FREE even when the
                    shareware non-beta version of JARCS is released
    GO32.EXE        The DOS extender for running JARCSX.EXE (32-bit dist only)
    JARCS.DOC       The registration key, also doubling up as a documentation
                    file. If you delete this file, you can't run JARCS :)

--=[ WARNING ]======---------------------------------------------------------

Well 0.93 beta circulation 0 has been successful in unpacking. I do think 
that some anti-virus softwares will be able to kill the program tho'.

The beta circulation 2 of version 0.93 contains "Da Jeneral (Un)Pack Shell"
for updating archives, and nothing else. If I want to go around implementing
all the others, I will need to go and get the configs for the archivers 
working. It's gonna be hard :)

Another WARNING on JARCS. JARCS DOES NOT CURRENTLY STORE FILES' TIMESTAMPS, 
NOR SCAN DIRECTORIES TO STORE FILES, THEREFORE YOU CANNOT SPECIFY *.* AS 
FILESPEC FOR JARCS !!

The GAMMA circulation has the JARCS' own JSW003 compression installed as
-C4. It has been throughly tested by quite a lot of people and it seems
to work. However if you think the program is producing some garbage, please
give me the version number, and the file you tried to compress failing. Also
which version of JARCS you tried to use (JARCS, JARCSD, JARCSX, UNJAR).
JSW003 file format has changed over versions, and if you feed older version
archives to this version of JARCS in JSW003 format, the result is
undefined. Maybe a corrupt file :(

--=[ COMMAND LINES ]=====----------------------------------------------------


Examples are here :


JARCS A -PZIP Archive Filename
  
  Adds Filename to archive using ZIP. Also other compressions supported:
    LHA, ARJ, RAR

JARCS A Archive Filename Filename2

  Add Filename and Filename2 to the archive distributedly using SIXPACK

JARCS A -S Archive Filename Filename2

  Add Filename and Filename2 to the archive solidly using SIXPACK

JARCS A -C1 Archive Filename

  Add Filename to archive distributedly using LZHUF
  
JARCS A -C1 -S Archive Filename

  Add Filename to archive solidly using LZHUF

JARCS V Archive

  View the contents of the archive

JARCS E Archive filename filename2 ...

  Extract filename and filename2 from the archive.

JARCS T Archive

  Tests the content of the archive

JARCS Z Archive Commentfile

  Adds a comment to the archive

JARCS S Archive

  Creates a Self-Extracting archive

JARCS A -A Archive filename

  Creates an archive with analytic mode on, this implies that every single
  compression available is used with the archive, and leaves the best only.
  Quite good I think, to make THE BEST.

--=[ Da Jeneral Unpack Shell ]======-----------------------------------------

  "Da Jeneral Unpack Shell" is a feature in which you can use this JARCS 
  archiver as a shell for many other archiving programs.

  The configuration file, JARCS.INI which is designed to make Windows phreaks
  happier with, is used to configure the Jeneral Unpack Shell routines as
  well as other JARCS.

  Da Jeneral Unpack Shell is just execution of JARCS with slightly altered
  command line, namely adding the option '-p<archiver name>'. Initially
  you will have -pZIP -pLHA -pARJ and -pRAR defined. Most of them will not
  work for you, since the directory path the files are set to are not the
  directory path which your files are stored. It's just set to "C:\USER"
  for convenience purpose only, since most people who have been using VAX
  will want to set a C:\USER directory, and any user who doesn't have his
  own directory would have copied all the archivers to that directory...

  Anyway, so it's just the normal JARCS command line with -P option enabled.

  However, you don't need to have the -P option unless you are adding
  to the archive. Therefore, normally you can just say :

    JARCS E archive 

  and it will instantly unarchive the file for you.

  The configuration for JARCS used to be editable, but since I use 
  precompiled configuration file .CFG instead of .INI (JARCS.CFG is compiled
  version of JARCS.INI), you can't now. It's faster tho'.. only acceses
  the file 2 times, not about 20 times ...


  Anyway, without you fiddling with all this, you can just go and run
    JARCS E      
    JARCS T        
    JARCS V     
    JARCS A
  commands supporting PKZIP, RAR, LHA, ARJ and all sorts of stuffs... 14
  of them are supported, so run it :)

--=[ COMPRESSION METHODS ]=====----------------------------------------------


 0: SIXPACK     The one from DDJ's compression competition. Slick and FAST
                and compresses executable sort of files most.
 1: LZHUF       From the UNIX version of LHARC source-codes. Quite good 
                compression gained. Text files seem to compress with this
                method the best.
 2: JUNRLE      JPMdL/Junichi Uekawa's implementation of RLE method. Modified
                somewhat, as always is. FAST and does not require much
                memory in decompression. Graphics files, pretty text files
                with loads of repeating characters always gets good 
                compression with this method... But it's basically impractical.
 3: JUNRLE-2    JPMdL/Junichi Uekawa's implementation of RLE method level 2.
                added in 0.91. A more efficient method of RLE compression 
                that uses the most infrequent number for the escape code for
                JunRLE compression packet. It uses a new format called 
                JunRLE-2 packet. Quite good, I daresay. Anyway, compresses
                the solid archives better !!
 4: JSW003      JPMdL/Junichi Uekawa's implementation of his own compression
                method that uses a Sliding Window that does not slide :) It's
                quite good compression. However, haven't found the optimal
                compression yet, so you can go and change the -XA values
                and -XB values yourself to make it compress best, and you
                will tell me the one that work best, won't you ??? :)
 5: JSW004A     JPMdL/Junichi Uekawa's implementation of his own compression
                method that does not mimick any of LZSS, LZW, Huffman, nor 
                RLE. Potentially VERY fast, but the compression is not very
                impressive...
