### toolsdist folder

This folder holds the original distributable file for each of the tools in the 
`tools/` folder which keeps all of the original README, *.DOC, LICENSE, etc files
together with the executable.

The idea being we do not distrubute any executable seperate from it's
documentation, license information, source code, and so on.

At run time, the first time you need a tool, it will be unpacked and copied
to the `tools/` folder automatically.

#### Attribution

These tools are attributed to many software authors dating from as early as 1980
until today. Only tools that are no longer available via their original authors
should be kept here. These were mostly mirrored from sites such as https://www.sac.sk/

Each tool is copyright under the license terms of its original author. You can read
the original authors license and copyright information in each file.
